      <h2>Problem Solving</h2>
<h4>A time I was blocked on a problem</h4>
      <p>I was stuck on a problem called 'Where are you' which involved defining
        a function to find a piece of data in an array. Although i knew about some of the terms involved i hadn't really encountered this specific problem before.
        I started by writing pseudocode which helped me breakdown the problem into smaller pieces. I then identified what I could and could not do, tackeld what I could and then used the internet to update my knowledge.
        Throughout the process i felt calm and motivated. And i managed to learn a new technique in terms of arrays, the .find() method. </p>

       <h4>A time I elegantly solved a problem</h4> 
       
       
       <p> I was working on a problem called 'DeBee', it was in the built-in methods problem set. I solved this problem very elegantly. 
        I think this was due to the fact that my prerequisite knowledge was upto scratch from having learned some python aswell as JS.
        I used the console.log() technique to acquire accurate feedback as I went about solving the problem. I felt very good, and I learned more about how to edit array items aswell as the .split() method.


        <h4>Problem solving techniques</h4>

        <p>I dont feel that confident using pseudocode as it isnt always intuitive exactly how a problem should be broken down.
            I feel pretty confident trying something as I seem to always have ideas about how something might work even if it wrong at least i have ruled something out.
            I feel comfortable using the rubberducky method it helps quite a lot.
            Reading error messages I am quite confident with and this always helps a ton.
            Similarly, console.log has proven to be a great tool and I am very confident using it.
            Googling is helpful, and stack overflow is a great website to learn more about what one is trying to code.
I have a mixed opinion of asking for help from peers or facilitators, I know that they are happy to help but I can't help but feel <I></I> am distracting them.
I am pretty confident at reflecting and i do most of it in my head when thinking about a problem.
