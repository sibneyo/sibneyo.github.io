<h3>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>

<p></p>My long term goal is to become a lead developer in a company. I dont just want to know web development. On the job i want to learn how to build applications.

<p>I think my strengths are that I can understand complex concepts and I learn fast.

    I think a limitation is that a get frustrated when I am acquring new skills and the feedback is muddled.</p>

<p>I will use a pomodoro timer to stay on top of my work load, and work on weekends if catchup is required. For group work I will control my emotions so that my frustrations dotnt negatively impact on others.
    I will seek help if I cant solve a problem in  20 minutes.
    </p>

<p>I expect empathy for my position as a learner in this industry. </p>
