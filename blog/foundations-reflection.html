<h2>Foundations Core Relfection</h2>
<h4>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h4>
<ol>
    <li>I find it very difficult to ask for help.</li>
    <li>I often shy away from frustrating tasks.</li>
    <li>It feels really good to overcome a challenge.</li>
  </ol>
  

<h4>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h4>
<p>Values are hugely important because they allow one insight into what makes one tick. Empathy is important because
    it allows cohesion between programmers. Self awareness is key because it allows you catch yourself when you arent coping.
</p>


<h4>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h4>
<p>Mostly I have been suprised by how it has changed my attitude towards tackling problems. It is not a simple matter of technical skill, it also involves self monitoring.</p>


<h4>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h4>
<p>The most challenging part is expressing what I have learned in words.</p>


<h4>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h4>
<p>I think the industry as a whole must be lacking people who have these skills, which prove vital for the next generation of coders to have, in order for businesses to run successfully.</p>


<h4>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h4>
<p>I dont think it is a waste time. I believe this because, from my experience, I have had to implent what I have learned from core to stay on track with the technical side.</p>
