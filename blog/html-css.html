      <h2>Positioning in CSS: Relative, Absolute and Fixed</h2>

      <h3>Intro:</h3>
      <p>
        Positioning in CSS is how elements are spaced on the screen. In ordinary
        html, elements travel for left to right and top to bottom along 'blocks'
        One block is one iteration from left to right with out dropping down.
      </p>

      <p>
        Positioning enables a user to move an element based on a pixel
        coordinate and reference point, for example:

        <br />
        <br />

        position: Relative; <br />top: 200px;<br /><br />

        will position the element 200px down from the top of the browsing
        window. Imagine the whitespace below is browser window:
      </p>

      <div id="parent">
        <div class="child"></div>
      </div>
      <p>As you can see the red square is dropped down 200px.</p>
      <h3>Relative, Abosolute, and Fixed:</h3>

      <p>
        The qualities of relative positioning are that it moves an element in
        reference to the browser window and will leave the space of its original
        position vacant. As though it was still there but is not visible.
      </p>

      <p>
        The qualities of absolute positioning is that, unlike relative, the
        space of its original position will be vacant. Also absolute is in
        reference to a parent element as opposed to the browser window.
      </p>

      <p>
        The qualities of fixed is that it is 'fixed' in relation to the viewport
        so it will travel with the browser even when one scrolls up, down, or
        from side to side. Like absolute positioning, fixed positioning makes
        the original position of the element vacant. Other elements will
        therefore move into this space.
