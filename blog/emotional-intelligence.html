<h2>Emotional Intelligence Quotent:</h2>



<h3>What is emotional intelligence? </h3>


<p>Emotional intelligence is a combination of self awareness/management 
    and other awareness/management. It is ones ability to understand and manage 
    the emotions of self and other.</p>


<h3>
    How is EQ different to IQ?</h3>

<p>

    IQ involves problem solving as it relates to technical factors like 
    critical thinking, analytical thinking, creative thinking, idea synthesis etc.


EQ is different and seeks to solve problems like 
win/win social interactions, conflict management, 
harmonizing work/family/peer group environments, 
inspiring and motivating others, the list goes on.

    
    </p>

<h3> Why is EQ important?</h3>
 <p>EQ has been statistically proven to be important
    infact each grade scale point of EQ translates to a $1300 increase in yearly salary.
    I can illustrate its importance by comparing the difference between a low and high eq.
    With low eq people are less likely to understand their emotional reactions or be able to control them.
    The are less able to manage strong emotions like anger. 
    They have trouble interpreting how others are feeling/ how their actions impact on others mood.
    In contrast those with a high eq have tools for managing their emotionsla state, they respond instead of reacting.
    They are students of body language and can therefore 'read between the lines' as to how others feel.
    they can influence the emotions of people around them to make them feel better.
    Due to the nature of work and the world these days being somewhat chaotic, these skills are highly valuable.</p>
