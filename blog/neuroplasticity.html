      <h2>Neuroplasticity and Mindset</h2>

      <p>Neuroplasticity is the phenenoma where the brains nerual pathways change themselves with experience.
        It is a phenenoma that can be very beneficial as it allows people to learn and adapt to circumstances.
        I have engaged with Neuroplasticity to be able to think more flexibly about coding problems.
        I have presonally increased my neuroplasticity by engaging with complex problems.

      <p>A growth mindset means to believe in the ability of anyone to improve in a domain of skills.
        It is the contrast to the fixed mindset which is when someone believes that abilities are innate and immutable.
        It is very relevant to coding because coding is frustrating to learn. If you did not believe that you could improve you would give up too easily.
        In my learning journey I will definitely push forward with a growth mindset, the reason being, from this apprroach failure is incorporated as part of the learning process, not something to be ashamed about.
