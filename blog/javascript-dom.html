<h2>Javascript and the DOM</h2>

<p>Javascript is a programming language often referred to as the language of the web. It is responsible for the actions pursuable on a webpage.
    In other words, it is responsible for the behaviour of a webpage. This is different to HTML, which more dictate the objects that form on the web page and their structure. 
    This is again different from CSS which is responsible to the stylstic elements of such objects.
</p>

<p>An aspect of coding in Javascript is called 'flow control'. Flow control describes how the code reads from top to bottom and therefore how it executes when a web page as live.
    For example a page has two functions written into its JS code. The functions contradict each other one defines when a pop-up should occur and the other defines a different trigger for the same pop up. The code written last will override the first function. This is an example of sloppy coding however it is good example of how flow control works.</p>

    <p>Loops describe code that makes the computers perform a repetitive task. Most loops only run until an objective, such as a specfic number of iterations, is achieved, or perhaps a boolean value demonstrates true or false. In fact a loop that does not stop after achieving some kind of objective is likely to crash ones computer.
        A real life analogy for a loop could be repeatedly throwing a scrunched up piece of paper at a bin until the condition is met that the paper is in the bin.
    </p>
   
<p>The document object model or DOM, Is a way of structuring data involved in a webpage so that it can be efficiently intereacted with by using DevTools.
    The basics of the dom is that the highest order 'object' is the document or webpage as a whole. The DOM then branches from the document, like a tree down to its smallest constituents which are referred to as elements. The constiuents of every level of branching are referred to as objects and are reprsented graphically as nodes.
The role of DevTools is to allow nodes and 'families' elements to be edited and analysed with ease. The result of this is being able to edit any webpage.  </p>

<p>Back to Javascript. Javscript has objects which are variables that are given internal properties witha key, the name of property, and a value, the specfic attribute status of the key.
    Javascript also has arrays which or similar to objects however the act more as a bag that can multiple things, like intergers and strings.
    Javascript also has function which are called using the word 'function' prior to making a variable. Functions are usually used to tell the computer to do something, like add two numbers or concatenate a string, they can be much more complex in function however.
    They are helpful because a well designed function does one thing and does it well. functions can help save one from writing many lines of code by interacting with several other parts of the written code and they can be called by writing simply their variable name.
