    <h3>Values:</h3>
    
    <div><p id= 'values'>Self Reliance    Beauty   Curiosity    Growth    Knowledge    Compassion</p></div>
    
   <div> I would describe the above values as my core values, they are the ones most important to me and they are part of what makes me who I am.</div>
    
     <h3>So how did these values come to be?</h3>
    
    <div> One thing people should know about me is that I am very headstrong, although my thinking can be flexible, I always follow the dictates of my own conscience.</div>
    
     <div>Please take me seriously when I say my values do not come from my friends my family or society at large. They come from me and my firsthand experience of the world.</div>
    
    <div>Yes when I was younger my values probably came from adults in my enviroment. Parents and Teachers. However early in my youth I decided that I was my own person, and that was that.</div> 
    
    <h3>Why these values?</h3>
    
    <div>Alot of my value makeup is how I naturally am. The part the enviroment has to play is that it provided the structures for the 'me-ness' to flourish or dwindle depending on the circumstances and times of my life. I am very curious by nature, which leads me to seek knowledge. By nature, knowledge promotes growth. Beauty is something I am naturally drawn too, compassion I believe is the native state of all humans. My experiences in the world have taught me the neccissity of self reliance, so maybe this last value is not intrinsic to who I am.</div> 
    
    <h3>Environmental Factors</h3>
    
     Although my values are self deteremined. They have been encouraged (for lack of a better term) by people in my life. 
    
     My Parents aided my curiosity as a grew up by allowing my to explore different hobbies, subjects at school, clubs, activities etc. They aided my self reliance by fostering my independence during adolenscence. They aided my compassion by teaching me to be good others.
    
     My friends aided my growth through good spirited rivalry at all sorts of tasks and activities. This includes my school mates who aided my knowledge when collaborating/competing in academic ventures.
    
     Beauty is very important value to me that contributes greatly to the richness and satifcation in my life. At many stages of life my understanding of beauty has taken twists and turns due the introdutction of novel insights about art, food, design, and other aspects of culture and nature.
    
     <h3>An Ethical Decision</h3>
    
     On one occassion I encountered a man on the street at night who had passed out and decided wait with him after calling an ambulance. Why? Compassion. 
    
     Looking back I think it was a good decision because that man's condition could have worsened overnight.
    
     <h3>STRENGTHS RAWR!</h3>
    
     <div> <p id="strength-list">Thinking Skills  |  People Skills  |  Tenacity</p></div>
    
     I think my strengths will assist my as coding is mainly a cognitive activity (thinking skills) that has frustrations (tenacity) and involves working with others (people skills).
    
    <h3>Limitations</h3>
    
    <div>I think a limitation of mine is probably time management and being properly thorough.</div>
    <div>I can see these holding me back somewhat as time management will be key in not falling behind and coding requires thoroughness and precision as one wrong charcter can stuff an entire piece of code.</div>
    
    <h3>Working with others</h3>
    
    One time when i was making music as a group we all had ideas for how the song would go.
    they strategy we came up with to resolve this was to use all of our ideas to a partial degree. However this backfired when the song came out subpar. A better strategy would have been to have a rock off (rock, paper, scissors) so that there was dissapointment but it was fair.

        <li>Growth</li>
        <li>Knowledge</li>
        <li>Compassion</li></ol>
    
    <h2>Stories of how these values were demonstrated in practice:</h2>
    
    <div></div>Self Reliance was demonstrated when I did the work.
    
    <div></div>Beauty was demonstrated when I looked out the window.
    
    <div></div>Curiosity was demonstrated when engaging with new concepts.
    
    <div></div>Growth was demonstrated as I learned about Git, GitHub, and Version Control and put the skills I learned into practice.
    
    <div></div> Knowledge was demonstrated when I internalized what I had learned over the past few days.
    
    <div></div> Compassion was demonstrated when interacting with staff members understanding that they are another human going about their day.
    
    <h2>Evidence of Values:</h2>
    
    <div></div>Self Reliance: My self reliance is evidenced by my commitment to a self supported routine, where do as much as i can on my own, including mananging my finances.
    I take full responsibility for my Physical, mental, emotional wellbeing.
    
    <div></div>Beauty: The value of beauty is exemplified by my aesthetic sense. I am a lover of visual art, performance art, the wind through the trees, and a bird feeding its young, I see beauty reflected in nature and in the world of humans, beauty is everywhere for those who have appreciative eyes. 
    
    <div></div> Curiosity: My curiosity is evidenced by the way I interact woth the world. I ask alot of questions about what things are, how they work, and why they are there in the first place. My curiosity extends from people and who they are to the natural wotld through the lense of biology physics chemistry and maths. To the the workings of machines, and the abstract symbolic realms of philospohy and literature. Unless I perceive a detail
    as mundane or banal, I want to know everything about everything.
    
    <div></div>Growth: My commitment to growth is evidenced by my daily activities. The very reason for coming to dev academy is in pursuit of growth. In my spare time I lean into growth by improving the music I create, nuturing my relationships, reading books, and exercising. To me life edoesnt make much sense without growth.
    
    <div></div>Knowledge: The value I place on Knowledge is evidenced by the amount of information I consume, be it from youtube, books, good conversations. I enjoy knowledge of all kinds, conceptual/abstract vs practical/concrete.
    
    <div></div>Compassion: My value on compassion is eveidenced by how I treat people in circles I am involved with, this means being polite, coopertative, taking others beliefs and perspectives onboard, as well as being generous with my possessions.
    
   
    
  
    <h2>Visuals or narratives of where your values come from:</h2>
    
   <div>I think my values come from who I am as an individual, how I have received life's experiences and how I have internalised them and chosen to go forward. Alot if this has been interacting with other people and being inspired by role models, therefore an element of nuture too is involved. My values have been self constructed predominantly.</div> 
    <div>I am a very indepedent thinker, therefore my values are unlikely to have to come from anywhere other than when I have made up my mind about something. They have however been fortified by others, for example an art history teacher I had fuelled into my value of beauty by exposing me to different eras of art works. Stories about business leaders that have achieved great things, fuel into my value of self reliance, etc.</div>
    
    
    
   <h3>Proverbs:</h3>
    
    <div>I know only one thing: that I know nothing.</div>
    <div>Do not go where the path may lead, go instead where there is no path and leave a trail.</div>
